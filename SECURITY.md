# Security Policy

## üîê Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

**CRITICAL**: Never commit files containing credentials or secrets to the repository!

- ‚úÖ Use `.env.local` for all sensitive data (already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Use `.env.example` as a template with placeholder values only
- ‚úÖ Generate strong, random secrets for production
- ‚úÖ Rotate secrets regularly
- ‚ùå Never commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.production`, or any file with real credentials
- ‚ùå Never share your `.env.local` file with anyone
- ‚ùå Never include credentials in code or configuration files

### Credentials Storage

All sensitive credentials should be stored securely:

- **Development**: `.env.local` (gitignored)
- **Production**: Environment variables on the server (not in repository)
- **CI/CD**: Encrypted secrets in your CI/CD platform

### Required Secrets

The following secrets must be generated and stored securely:

1. **JWT_SECRET**: Generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
2. **DATABASE_URL**: Contains database password - never commit!
3. **GITHUB_TOKEN**: Personal access token - never commit!
4. **REDIS_PASSWORD**: If using Redis - never commit!

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the security team at: security@fushuma.com
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will respond within 48 hours and work with you to address the issue.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Authentication

- Web3 wallet-based authentication using message signing
- JWT tokens with secure, random secrets
- HTTP-only cookies for session management
- Nonce-based replay attack prevention

### API Security

- tRPC for type-safe API communication
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Protected procedures requiring authentication
- Admin-only procedures for sensitive operations

### Database Security

- Parameterized queries via Drizzle ORM (prevents SQL injection)
- Secure connection strings
- Principle of least privilege for database users

### Network Security

- HTTPS enforced in production
- Security headers configured in `next.config.ts`
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting (to be implemented)

### Dependencies

- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning
- No known vulnerabilities in dependencies

## üìã Security Checklist for Deployment

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Generated strong JWT_SECRET (at least 32 bytes)
- [ ] Set secure database password
- [ ] Configured HTTPS/SSL
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Enabled firewall (UFW)
- [ ] Configured security headers
- [ ] Set up regular backups
- [ ] Implemented monitoring and logging
- [ ] Reviewed all environment variables
- [ ] Ensured no secrets in code or repository
- [ ] Set up fail2ban or similar intrusion prevention
- [ ] Configured rate limiting
- [ ] Enabled database encryption at rest (if available)

## üîÑ Security Updates

We regularly:

- Update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities
- Review and improve security practices
- Monitor for security advisories
- Conduct security audits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

While we strive to maintain the highest security standards, no system is 100% secure. Users are responsible for:

- Securing their own wallet private keys
- Verifying transactions before signing
- Keeping their systems and browsers updated
- Using strong, unique passwords
- Enabling two-factor authentication where available

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. If you see something, say something!
